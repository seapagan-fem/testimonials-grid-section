## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fun and straight-forward use of grids. I also added a second
responsive breakpoint between the mobile and desktop just so it wasn't such a
glaring break - I mixed up the card order a little for that one to get a
slightly better color mix.
